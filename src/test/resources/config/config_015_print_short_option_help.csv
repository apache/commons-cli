HELP_COMMAND_NAME=foo

# Implementors do not need to define HELP_OPTION_NAME - they can
# 
# The name must:
#   - match the option.[name] option configuration. For example, if 
#     HELP_OPTION_NAME is defined as 'help' (not including apostrophes), then
#     there must also be an option definition named 'option.help';
#   - option.[name] hasArg must be false;
#   - option.[name] must have a description
# 
# Defining this will print the help for the defined options then quit with 0
# status.
#
