<p>
The Apache Commons CLI library provides an API for processing command line interfaces.
</p>
</section>
<!-- ================================================== -->
<section name="1.x vs 2.x?">
<p>
Commons CLI 1.0 was formed from the merger of ideas and code from three different libraries -
Werken, Avalon and Optz. In dealing with the bugs and the feature requests a freshly designed and not backwards compatible 
CLI 2.0 was created, but never finished or released. Since then a CLI 1.1 bugfix release has been made.
</p>
<p>
There are currently no plans to continue the 1.x line beyond bugfixes. The 2.x design is generally preferred and is in use, 
however there is no current activity to make a 2.0 release. To this end, the 1.1 release is recommended to most users 
while the 2.x line is recommended for anyone interested in helping to get this better API released.

        CLI1 was formed by the merger of ideas and code from three different
        libraries and allows most simple interfaces to be modelled.  CLI1
        became increasingly difficult to maintain and develop further and so
        CLI2 has been developed with the goals of clearer responsibilities and
        being more flexible.  The intention is that CLI2 should be able to
        model a far greater selection of interfaces and do so more completely,
        validating as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The redesigned CLI2 is rooted in the <code>org.apache.commons.cli2</code>
        package and the distribution retains the <code>org.apache.commons.cli</code>
        package so that the upgrade doesn't break old code.  The CLI1 package
        should be regarded as deprecated to encourage the transition to the
        more flexible CLI2 framework but minor bug fixes and patches may be
        accepted to ensure that CLI1 based applications continue to function as
        expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the documentation is split into the following three sections:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="manual/index.html">CLI2</a> - a reference manual for version 2</li>
          <li><a href="introduction.html">CLI1</a> - documentation for version 1 </li>
          <li><a href="examples/index.html">Examples</a> - a selection of worked examples demonstrating CLI2 features</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The latest version of this documentation is available on the web:

        The generated list of <a href="dependencies.html">dependencies</a> 
        lists the libraries needed to compile and test Commons CLI.  To use 
        the precompiled distribution none of these dependancies are strictly 
        necessary.  The following is a breakdown of what is required and when:

        </tr>

          <td>Java 1.2</td>
          <td>This is the minimum java level needed to use CLI2</td>
