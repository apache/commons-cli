    <section name="Commons CLI">
      <p>
        The Apache Commons CLI library provides an API for parsing command line options passed to programs.
        It's also able to print help messages detailing the options available for a command line tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commons CLI supports different types of options:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>POSIX like options (ie. <code>tar -zxvf foo.tar.gz</code>)</li>
        <li>GNU like long options (ie. <code>du --human-readable --max-depth=1</code>)</li>
        <li>Java like properties (ie. <code>java -Djava.awt.headless=true -Djava.net.useSystemProxies=true Foo</code>)</li>
        <li>Short options with value attached (ie. <code>gcc -O2 foo.c</code>)</li>
        <li>long options with single hyphen (ie. <code>ant -projecthelp</code>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A typical help message displayed by Commons CLI looks like this:
      </p>
      <source>
usage: ls
 -A,--almost-all          do not list implied . and ..
 -a,--all                 do not hide entries starting with .
 -B,--ignore-backups      do not list implied entried ending with ~
 -b,--escape              print octal escapes for nongraphic characters
    --block-size &lt;SIZE>   use SIZE-byte blocks
 -c                       with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last
                          modification of file status information) with
                          -l:show ctime and sort by name otherwise: sort
                          by ctime
 -C                       list entries by columns
      </source>

    <section name="1.x vs 2.x?">
      <p>Commons CLI 1.0 was formed from the merger of ideas and code from three different libraries -
      Werken, Avalon and Optz. In dealing with the bugs and the feature requests a freshly designed and not
      backwards compatible CLI 2 was created, but never finished or released. Since then bugfix releases
      have been made for CLI 1.</p>

      <p>The current plan is to maintain the 1.x line until CLI 2 is officially released. The 2.x design is generally
      preferred and is in use, however there is no current activity to make a 2.0 release. To this end, the 1.2
      release is recommended to most users while the 2.x line is recommended for anyone interested in helping to get
      this better API released.</p>

              CLI1 was formed by the merger of ideas and code from three different
              libraries and allows most simple interfaces to be modelled.  CLI1
              became increasingly difficult to maintain and develop further and so
              CLI2 has been developed with the goals of clearer responsibilities and
              being more flexible.  The intention is that CLI2 should be able to
              model a far greater selection of interfaces and do so more completely,
              validating as much as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              The redesigned CLI2 is rooted in the <code>org.apache.commons.cli2</code>
              package and the distribution retains the <code>org.apache.commons.cli</code>
              package so that the upgrade doesn't break old code.  The CLI1 package
              should be regarded as deprecated to encourage the transition to the
              more flexible CLI2 framework but minor bug fixes and patches may be
              accepted to ensure that CLI1 based applications continue to function as
              expected.
